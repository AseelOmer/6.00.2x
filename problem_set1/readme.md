# Space Cows Transport Problem

This project implements two algorithms for transporting cows across space: a **Greedy** algorithm and a **Brute Force** algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional dependencies

## Files

- `ps1.py`: Contains the greedy and brute force algorithms.
- `ps1_partitions.py`: Helper functions for partitioning.
- `ps1_cow_data.txt`: Data containing cows and their weights.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure all required files are in the same folder.
3. Run `ps1.py` to see the results for the greedy and brute force algorithms.

## Example

Input (from `ps1_cow_data.txt`):
